t=Search
Son of a mother
Son of a father
You can look inside you
You can look inside me
Come on and search!
Search deep inside
You can put it together
You can pull it apart
You relapse unconscious
You don't remember!

t=Tension
When you're revealing I get that feeling
Of a blind man in bed
Couldn't hear what I said
No way
When you're revealing
I get that feeling
Of a monk in a church
A big empty church

t=Ruins
Culture moves the hands
Of the man yet scanned
Whose judgment?
The matter was life
Who got the hand shake?
The ruins of a culture still maimed
Remember the camps before you were born
The mourn of the families
Culture moves the hands
Of the man yet scanned

t=The Punch Line
I believe when they found the body of General George A. Custer
Quilled like a porcupine with Indian arrows
He didn't die with any honor, any dignity, or any valor
I believe when they found George A. Custer
An American general, patriot, and Indian-fighter
He died with shit in his pants!

t=History Lesson
A hundred thousand years ago before legends were ever told
Homo Sapiens stood erect, mind empty and mind fresh
Created love and hate
Then God and Anti-God
Human slaughtered
Human
First with stone
Then with metal
Now with heat
It was all for power

t=Fanatics
There's a hanging in Turkey.
Two necks in a noose
One's a rightist
The other's a leftist.
What the fuck?
Fanatics!

t=Gravity
Against The flux
Play the field; push the wheel
Horizontal
Silently talkin'
Being boxed in by friends friends friends of friends and so on
Fruitless triumph Newton's search only proves that flesh and muscle are being pulled off our bones

t=Bob Dylan Wrote Propaganda Songs
I'm waiting
And diversing
I'm collecting
Dispersing
Information
Liberation
Bob Dylan wrote propaganda songs!
Manifesto
On my window
And my fruit
Rotation
Admiration
Outline my root
Bob Dylan wrote propaganda songs!

t=The Anchor
Made a dream last night
Wish I hadn't awoken
Wind blew warm in my face
Naked in an Epsom
Five beautiful girls around me
I was so damn bad
I took them on one at a time
Wake up, heart yanked out
Anchor dragging behind

t=Self-Referenced
Burned-out wreck spotted on the beach: a symbol of my life
How can I believe in books when my heart lies to me?
I'm full of shit!
Bumming real hard on cold steel facts - I'm full of shit!

t=Dreams Are Free, Motherfucker!
Instrumental
t=The Toe Jam
Instrumental

t=Little Man With A Gun In His Hand
The highest love, a woman's touch
Harmony, a strong mind, a strong body, beauty
All the things He couldn't be
All The things he couldn't have
Little man with a gun in his hand

t=Shit You Hear At Parties
Sometimes the news is like a loud hum in my amplifier
It rings my head out like a filthy washcloth
With little folds; thousands of little folds!
The shit you hear at parties
Kick in the idiot box
Wait for the news in the history books
Like junkies who hate their heroin

t=Party With Me Punker
Party with me, punker!
Party with me, punker!
In a condo
In an air raid shelter
In a photo booth
The fascist pogo
Party with me, punker!
Party with me, punker!
With napalm
With marijuana
With a clenched fist
With the history of the world
Party with me, punker!

t=Anxious Mo-Fo
Serious as a heart attack!
Makes me feel this way
No device to measure, no word can define
I mean what I’m trying to say is
How can I express – let alone possess?
Serious as a heart attack!
Makes me feel this way

t=Viet Nam
Let’s say I got a number
That number’s fifty thousand
That’s ten percent of five hundred thousand
Oh, here we are in French Indochina!
Executive order, congressional decision
The working masses are manipulated
Was this our policy?
Ten long years
Not one domino shall fall

t=It's Expected I'm Gone
I don't want to hurt
See, my position was here
I mean, as it was, I was
So this led to the downfall of man
I can make seconds feel hours
I make certain that my head is connected to my body
No hope?
See, that's what gives me guts
Big fucking shit!
Right now, man

t=Two Beads At The End
Caught by a camera taken at shutter speed
My neck's in a knot, two beads at the end
Bolt cutters close, my head rolls again
Trapped in your snare, voices fly at me
Snap like a tiger, strikes like a snake
Feel like a poker in someone's fireplace

t=Do You Want New Wave Or Do You Want The Truth?
A word war will set off the keg
My words are war
Should a word have two meanings?
What the fuck for?
Should words serve the truth?
I stand for language
I speak the truth
I shout for history
I am the cesspool
For all the shit to run down in

t=Shit From an Old Notebook
Let the products sell themselves!
Fuck advertising, commercial psychology
Psychological methods to sell should be destroyed
Because of their own blind involvement in their own conditioned minds
The unit bonded together
Morals, ideals, awareness, progress
Let yourself be heard!

t=Nature Without Man
The boundary, the border of right and wrong
The tariff is self, the freedom of feeling the criminal
The pied piper, the heart and mind
Nature without man

t=One Reporter's Opinion
What can be romantic to Mike Watt?
He’s only a skeleton
His body is a series of points with no height, length, or width
In his joints, he feels life
His strongest connection
Between the yelling and the sleep
Pain is the toughest riddle
He’s chalk!
He’s a dartboard!
His sex is disease!
He’s a stop sign!

t=Maybe Partying Will Help
As I look over this beautiful land
I can't help but realize that I am alone
Why am I able to waste my energy
to notice life being so beautiful?
Maybe partying will help
And what of the people who don't have what I ain't got?
Are they victims of my leisure?
To fail is to be a victim
To be a victim of my choice
Maybe partying will help

t=Toadies
No. 7 on the chump list
Playing stooge, eatin' shit
Using that as a reason
For kickin' shit on the dumb fucks
We are cuss-words, nearly illiterate
Dedicated to fightin' toadies

t=Retreat
Real things conditioning will lose their meaning
The toilet starts flushing; sets me off again
But I am a thorn, I read it in your face
The cough's a thunderclap, my head's a tape recorder

t=The Big Foist
A richer understanding of what's already understood
No meanings from the here and now
What gift could be a work of art?
Can you call it the big foist?
I'm fuckin' overwhelmed!

t=Corona
The people will survive in their environment
The dirt, scarcity and the emptiness of our South
The injustice of our greed, the practice we inherit
The dirt, scarcity and the emptiness of our South
There on the beach, I could see it in her eyes
I only had a Corona, five-cent deposit

t=The Glory Of Man
Starting with the affirmation of man
I work myself backwards using cynicism
(the time monitor, the space measurer)
I live sweat but I dream light years
I am the tide - the rise and the fall
The reality soldier, the laugh child
The one of the many, the flame child
(the time monitor, the space measurer)

t=Take 5, D.
Hope we can rely on you not to use shower. You're not keeping tub caulked. Caused both downstairs bath ceilings and walls to be soggy. Tub has to properly caulked prior to any shower. Walls are drenched -- I'll refer plumber here. Had to pay for two service calls. Water drips from all around. Kathy's ceiling, my ceiling. Don't use shower. Don't use shower.

t=My Heart And The Real World
And so my soul collapsed into a big guilt wad
Some big thunder law forces me to eat shit
And if I was a word could my letters number a hundred?
More likely coarse and guttural one syllable Anglo-Saxon
I'm a victim of fact let's say I loved a girl
But the world was wrong and I was forced to march in line
But it felt like handcuffs
Machines disregard my pronouns
I am defeated, I'm a cool damp clay

t=History Lesson Part II
Our band could be your life
Real names'd be proof
Me and Mike Watt, we played for years
Punk rock changed our lives
We learned punk rock in Hollywood
Drove up from Pedro
We were fucking corndogs
We'd go drink and pogo
Mr. Narrator, this is Bob Dylan to me
My story could be his songs; I'm his soldier child
Our band is scientist rock
But I was E. Bloom, Richard Hell, Joe Strummer and John Doe
Me and Mike Watt, playing guitar

t=The Roar Of The Masses Could Be Farts
Soft and understanding eyes of the young
Moving with abandon atop the green lawns
Malleable as luck allows faking all the ties
Forced out in time
These expressions met
Improvised inventions lost in the way
Absolute the course which instinct betrays
Grinding in reversal
Outdo til done
Proper naked self
Solutions surround
In brightness be it real
Blinded and free
Pastel gems hit
Pearlesque in flaw
Spark of the instant
Challenging the time
View the observer's plagiarizing hands

t=Mr. Robot's Holy Orders
Force fed
Sifted
Tin can
Pull handle
Puppet
Pull toys

t=Themselves
All these men who work the land
Should evaluate themselves and make a stand
Can't they see beyond the rhetoric?
The lies and promises that don't mean shit
And all the men who learned to hate them

t=Please Don't Be Gentle With Me
Just wake up And tug my hair
And let me know
All of the outside world and you are there
And never be too gentle with me

t=Nothing Indeed
The interruption went
Small snag in life
Pothole in the road
It's only a detour
A minor deterrent
That can't unload
My examination Parts a to b
There is no cause
No cause at all
For my hesitation
Nothing indeed

t=This Ain't No Picnic
Working on the edge
Losing my self-respect
For a man who presides over me
The principles of his creed
Punch in, punch out
Eight hours, five days
Sweat, pain and agony
On Friday I'll get paid
This ain't no picnic
Hey mister don't look down on me
For what I believe
I got my bills and the rent
I should be content
But our land isn't free
So I'll work my youth away
In the place of a machine
I refuse to be a slave
This ain't no picnic

t=Spillage
A clear and dusty day in June
My stoned mind just spilled that line
Describing, what's it like, describing?
Believing that the sum is "yes"
Looking around at all my comrades
My police state mind just spilled that line
I want to give names to our bonds
I need names to play the game
But what makes my heart run?
Why the thunder in my thighs?
My body, my mind
The idea of my life seems like a symbol

t=Untitled Song For Latin America
The western hemisphere and all inside
We know who's murdering the innocent
They are children playing with guns
They are children playing with countries
Mining harbors, creating contras
The games they play, the lives they take
They bank their money in this country
They steal from the innocent
A colonial trait that's much too old
The banks, the lives, the profits, the lies
I would call it genocide
Any other word would be a lie

t=Jesus And Tequila
I had a girl
She loved what she saw
She loved me so good
She made her daddy mad
My woman cried
She's dead to me now
My woman ran off
And I can't deny it
My life - Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
I had a job
It paid me good
I could have my phone
And tip the preacher too
My boss yelled
He's dead to me now
My boss kicked me out
And I can't deny it
My life - Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
You better listen to me
'Cause I'm gonna tell you, son
Don't give away your love
And don't give away your sweat
Because a girl can't know you
And a boss can't afford you
Remember Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it

t=Storm In My House
If I could, I surely would
Give my life to you
So you can have two
Take me in your arms and lie to me
You tell me it's always going
To be like this
The world is the coldest place
Surely the coldest place.
There's a storm inside my house
Raging and relentless
Wind tearing at the rafters
Howling through the timbers
Hard stinging rain
Falling in and falling down
Hope this storm doesn't rip my roof off
My skin keeps the storm inside

t=Martin's Story
What you makin', man?
Takes time
A little bit
A little bit more
The effort's worth it
Feels good
Designed by me
Try and try
That's the way you want it
If you know
That ain't the way it always goes
A little bit
A little bit more
What you makin', man?
Takes time

t=Little Man With A Gun In His Hand
The highest love, a woman's touch
Strong mind, strong body
All the things he couldn't be
All the things he couldn't have
Little man with a gun in his hand

t=The World According To Nouns
The state, the church, the plans
The waste, the dead, the mine, the cut
What's the verb behind it all?
The who, the how, the why, the where, the when, the what
Can these words refine that truth?

t=The Price Of Paradise
How I remember the history I have seen
I was just a young boy, the horror I couldnt forsee
All the pain that comes with war
All the scars that never heal
Here in paradise the price is cheap
Young men die for greed
Across the ocean in a land they call Vietnam
Young men dying is all it would cost
We were told and proudly believed
They would fight to keep us free
Here in America the price is cheap
Young men die for what?
My brother, the soldier was a hero who survived
He'd tell the stories of men who died without dreams
And they fight for men twice their age
The smell of death made his life change
The price of paradise is stained with blood
Why? All pawns and puppets of flesh and bone
Will die for their leaders far from their homes
These are men who died very young
Afraid to see that their cause was unjust
Why couldnt they live for life?
Not die to survive

t=The Big Stick
Now over there in Managua Square
With American made bombs falling everywhere
They kill women and children and animals too
These bombs are made by people like me and you
And we're told that we hold a big stick over them
But I know from what I've read that peace is in our hands
Now over there in Guatamala my friend
We're making mistakes there once again
Uncle Sam supports a fascist regime
That doesnt represent the people over there
We learn and believe there is justice for us all
And we lie to ourselves with a big stick up our ass
Now if we stand and yell it out
That war isn't what we're all about
Then someone will come and bring us back
To get the peace train back on its tracks
This is what I'm singing about
The race war that America supports
Indians will never die
They'll do just fine if we let them try
Though we hold, we're never told that peace is in our hands
If we stop there is time to heal the scars we've caused
To heal the scars we've caused

t=Political Nightmare
Someone's doing something
Confusion
Another invasion?
Sympathize with who?
Someone killed somebody
Confusion
Did anyone gain?
How much did it cost?
Woke up screaming
Someone changed sides
Everyone was dying
One too many votes
Satan won

t=Courage
Where's your courage? Are you afraid to die?
Are you happy that God is on your side?
I wrote this song in a story of men who died for glory
Where's your courage?
Do you think you're alone?
Are you laughing for being blind and pure?
I wrote this song in a story of men who died for glory
Where's your courage?
Do you share all you have?
Are you hiding from something you dont know?
Where's your courage?

t=The Red And The Black
Canadian mounted,baby
A police force that works
Red and black is their color scheme
Get their man in the end
It's all right... It's all right
You kill, you maim
You kill, you maim
Frontenac chateau, baby
I cross the frontier at ten
Got a whip in my hand, baby
And a girl or a huskie at leather's end
It's all right... It's all right
You kill, you maim
You kill, you maim
Hornswoop me bungo pony
Dog sled on ice
Make a dash for freedom, baby
Dont skate on polar ice
It's too thick to be sliced by the light
Of long,white polar nights
It's all right... It's all right
You kill, you maim
You kill, you maim
(Originally by Blue Oyster Cult)

t=Spoken Word Piece
Liberal Man meets Conservative Man
Conservative Man wears his myth on his skin
Liberal Man has to explain his and keeps his shirt all buttoned up
Conservative Man greets Liberal Man with a well-rehearsed cold stare
Liberal Man replies by issuing forth horseshit
Conservative Man retaliates by taking the concrete reality of the Situation and lodging it, like a wedge, right between both sides of Liberal Man's brain
Liberal Man is caught off guard by this apparent non-abstraction
There is one full minute of confusion
Liberal Man becomes Conservative Man
Conservative Man becomes Liberal Man
War is declared
Liberal Man cheats by calling in reinforcements
Conservative Man is set upon by a mob and murdered
Said mob then turns on Liberal Man and he dies a broken man

t=Stories
I heard one today about the one I love
I heard one earlier that shook me up
I heard one the other day, can't believe it's true
I heard one by accident wish I had it
I heard one so many times
I couldn't care any more

t=What Is It?
In your eyes I've seen it
In my silence it's heard
In a dream it lingers
In solitude it's known
In honesty I scream it
In panic I forget it
In desperation I need it
In time I lose it
In my mind I save it

t=Just Another Soldier
Over 300 dead, we still got pride
We've lost all our morals, we still got pride
Should we fight this war in some far corner of the globe
And learn how to die for some unjust cause
Is this our future?
Ashes are all that remain
It's easy when you got pride
How much pride does a dead soldier got?
His life so short, no chance to even start
The ones he left behind
The world he'll never see
But no one could deny that the soldier died with pride

t=Situations At Hand
There are still lofty dreams meager desires and still silliness

t=Political Song For Michael Jackson To Sing
List monitors arrive with petition
Iron-fisted philosophy
Is your life worth a painting?
Is this 'girl vs. boy' with different symbols?
Being born is power!
Scout leader Nazi tagged as 'big sin'
Your risk chains me hostage
Me, I'm fighting with my head, I am not ambiguous
I must look like a dork!
Me, naked with textbook poems spout fountain against the Nazis
With weird kinds of sex symbols in speeches that are big dance thumps
If we heard mortar shells, we'd cuss more in our songs
And cut down the guitar solos
So dig this big crux:
Organizing the boy scouts for murder is wrong
Ten years beyond the big sweat point
Man, it was still there, ever without you
Coming back around, look!
Coming together, for just a second, a peek, a guess
At the wholeness that's way too big

t=I Felt Like A Gringo
A ton of white boy guilt, that's my problem
Obstacle to joy (one reason for drugs)
Slept on a Mexican beach, slept in trash
(American trash) thinking too much can ruin a good time
I asked a Mexican who ran a bar for Americans: "who won" I said, "the election?"
He laughed and I felt like a gringo
We paid for a song and they had fun with us
Why can't you buy a good time?
Why are there soldiers in the streets?
Why did I spend the fourth in someone else's country?

t=Jesus And Tequila
I had a girl, she loved what she saw
She loved me so good, she made her daddy mad
My woman cried; she's dead to me now
My woman ran off, and I can't deny it
My life: Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied, and I can't deny it
I had a job; it paid me good
I could have my fun and tip the preacher too
My boss yelled; he's dead to me now
My boss kicked me out, and I can't deny it
My life: Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied, and I can't deny it
You better listen to me 'cause I'm gonna tell you, son
Don't give away your love and don't give away your sweat
Because a girl can't know you, and a boss can't afford you
Remember Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied and I can't deny it

t=King Of The Hill
What is peace to the people who work the land and die in wars?
It was learned in a game that was played by us all
Who held the top of the hill?
From the rest was called the king
And I can't believe it all was good for humankind
Is it peace to point the guns?
Is it war To fire the guns?
We would run with all of our might, push the king off to take the hill
And to learn who was king and who makes the better serf
I can't believe it all was good for humankind

t=Cut
Hey, ice machine will you cut me?
Thin line... Cut!
Big scissors!
Cut loose!
Bend!
Tense!
Big scissors!
Stop!
Cut!

t=Tour-Spiel
Born in the shed with the guitar on
We jammed the schtik to do for gigs.
With bits and pieces Of a working thesis
We jammed the schtik to do for gigs
Now when we took me and D. Boon and George's stench
And put them up on stage.
We'd fight at practice then jam econo
And spout the tour-spiel
I dreamed I was E Bloom But I woke up Joe Bouchard
In some town out on the road
With patent-leather boots on
Just like richard told me
Another hack on the Spectors tour
Now you got your guitar and your practice amp
You travel the USA in a van
And Troccoli's counting on some situation
Are you going to write the song I demand?
And with the guitar turned off
And the gas tank empty
And the typewriter on
But my head is empty
And to really find me I've got to look inside me
And cut the tour-spiel

t=Take Our Test
Say now My trip in line with others
Have the door pointing to others
Door means a separate wall is in between
Symbols assert the Big Butt Whoopin
Close your eyes, open them
Take our test!
Close your eyes, open them
Not since those days
This rhythm that is all head
What makes Breaks the fakes
Close your eyes, open them
Take our test!
Close your eyes, open them
Not since those days
And when reality appears digital
And the big hankering cometh
I'll vote yes for life in the big choice poll
I'll be glad I did
Your mind Organized by Nazis
Your heart and mind conspiring
Close your eyes, open them
Take our test!
Close your eyes, open them
Not since those days
Forever with you
Ever without you
Take our test!

t=Joe McCarthy's Ghost
Can you really be sure of the goddamn time of day?
Can you take the dirt from the fist of a foreigner?
Are you going to fight when they call out your number?
Can you toe the line?
Can you repeat what you've been told?
Can you bite the bullet?
Can you see the enemy?
Can you point the finger?
Can you prove your loyalty?
Joe McCarthy!

t=Anxious Mo-Fo
Serious as a heart attack!
Makes me feel this way
No device to measure
No word can define
I mean what I'm trying to say is
How can I express? (let alone possess)
Serious as a heart attack!
Makes me feel this way

t=Paranoid Chant
I try to work and I keep thinking of World War III
I try to talk to girls and I keep thinking of World War III
The goddamned six o'clock news makes sure I keep thinking of World War III
I got a mile of numbers and a ton of stats
Of warheads A billion Chinese with warheads
I don't even worry about crime any more
So many goddamned scared faces
I keep thinking of Russia, of Russia
Paranoid, stuck on overdrive
Paranoid, scared shitless
